    <h2 class="block-title">Conewago Canoe Club Membership Application for 2016.</h2>

<p>Memberships run from January 1 through December 31.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please read the following carefully before submitting this application.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This waiver is freely given in the interest of permitting the Conewago Canoe Club (hereinafter referred to as the CCC) to exist&nbsp;and enable myself and my fellow paddlers to donate our services and help each other without fear of liability. My waiver is&nbsp;given in exchange for similar waivers given by other members of the CCC and has no expiration date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hereby declare that I fully understand that any boating activity exposes participants to various hazards. I am aware that&nbsp;even skilled and prudent paddlers can experience emergencies. The risks I may encounter have been duly considered and no&nbsp;one other than me can be held responsible for my safety. I also declare that I will follow recommended safety practices, i.e.&nbsp;wearing of life jackets etc. and practice river courtesies while boating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hereby waive, release and discharge for myself, my personal representatives, my heirs and any member of my family any and&nbsp;all claims for damages for personal injury, property damage or death which I may have or which may hereafter accrue to me&nbsp;against the CCC, its members, trip coordinators or any of my fellow paddlers as a result of my participation in any club&nbsp;sponsored activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Conewago Canoe Club respects your privacy and promises to not share, sell, or distribute any of your personal information for business or personal gain. &nbsp;We also reserve the right to delete any content posted by members that we deem inappropriate, and in extreme cases, revoke membership.</strong></p>

<p>I agree to respect the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information of other club members and agree not to use any&nbsp;personal information (address, email address, phone #â€™s, etc.) for personal or business gain.&nbsp;</p>
